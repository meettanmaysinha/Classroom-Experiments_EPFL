Students from a school are reading a report about population demographics of their country as part of their reading assignment. The report outlines concepts from genetics as a refresher, and then reports some observations regarding the height and hair color of individuals in the population.

**REPORT**: 

**Part 1: Refresher on Genetics**

Genes are sections of information on DNA that determine how an organism's body will develop. You can think of DNA as an instruction manual for the body and genes as the specific instructions. Different copies of the same gene are called alleles. To understand the idea of dominant and recessive genes, imagine you had two teachers in your classroom (let's hope they don't give double homework!). If one teacher was shouting 'Take out your math homework' and the other teacher was whispering 'Open your English book,' which instructions would you follow? Most people would probably pull out their math assignments because those instructions were louder. Just like these teachers, some copies of a gene are louder than others. The instructions on these louder alleles are followed to make traits even when a copy of a quieter allele is around. These louder alleles that are expressed over others are called dominant. Alleles that are not expressed if a dominant allele is around are called recessive. Usually dominant alleles are expressed by capital letters (e.g., A, B, etc), and recessive alleles are expressed by small letters (e.g., a, b, etc). The entire set of genes, including the specific alleles, found in an organism's DNA is known as its genotype. So an organism's genotype is the specific set of instructions it carries around in its cells. Genotypes can only be determined by biological tests, not observations. Phenotype, on the other hand, is the physical expression, or characteristics, of a particular trait. Imagine waking up to a thump on the roof. You peek your head out your bedroom window and see an alien! How would you describe your visitor to your friends? You might talk about his green skin or big black eyes! When we describe how an organism, or living thing, looks we are describing its phenotype. Phenotype is the physical properties of an organism, everything you can observe from how they look to how they act. 

**Part 2: Some observations regarding height and hair color in the population** 

a) When both parents are tall and black-haired, the offspring is also tall and black-haired 

b) When both parents are short and grey-haired, the offspring is also short and grey-haired 

c) When both parents are tall and grey-haired, the offspring is also tall and grey-haired 

d) When both parents are short and black-haired, the offspring is also short and black-haired 

**^^^^^^^^^^^^^**


After looking at these observations, students inferred that there seemed to exist a strong positive correlation between the phenotype of the parents and the phenotype of the offspring. 

(i) Do you think this correlation between phenotype of the parents and phenotype of the offspring is meaningful?

(ii) Answer the four problem tasks below and briefly explain reasoning.

**Problem Task 1**: When one parent is tall and black-haired and the other parent is tall and grey-haired, what will the offspring be? 

**Problem Task 2**: When one parent is tall and grey-haired and the other parent is short and grey-haired, what will the offspring be? 

**Problem task 3**: When one parent is short and black-haired and the other parent is short and grey-haired, what will the offspring be? 

**Problem task 4**: When one parent is tall and grey-haired and the other parent is short and black-haired, what will the offspring be?

(iii) Finally, propose an association (causal structure) between the variables "genotype of parent (GP)", "genotype of offspring (GO)", "phenotype of parent (PP)", "phenotype of offspring (PO)".  """
