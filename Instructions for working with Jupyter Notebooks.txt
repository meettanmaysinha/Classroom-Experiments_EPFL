You will need “Jupyter Notebook” to work with these tasks. It is an executable document that can be run on a web browser and contains both code and rich text elements, such as figures, links, equations.
You can programmatically work with the workbook using Python.


1. Prerequisites to Run Jupyter Notebook:
Installing latest version of pip
# On Windows
python -m pip install -U pip setuptools
# On Mac OS X or Linux
pip install -U pip setuptools

Installing jupyter-notebook
# Python2
pip install jupyter
# Python 3
pip3 install jupyter

Installing git
# On Windows
Use the installer present at https://git-scm.com/downloads
#On Linux
sudo apt-get install git [for Debian and Ubuntu]
sudo yum install git-core [for Fedora]
# On Mac OS X
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew update
brew install git




2. Downloading the Tasks
Go to the terminal and type:
git clone https://github.com/meettanmaysinha/Classroom-Experiments_EPFL.git




3. Running the Task Notebooks
Go to the terminal and type:
cd Classroom-Experiments_EPFL
jupyter-notebook

A browser window will open up. Go to the folders:
a) “AQ ProblemSolvingTask” to access notebooks for problem-solving task 1 (only go to the workbook for your assigned condition)
b) “SC ProblemSolvingTask” to access notebooks for problem-solving task 2 (go to the workbook for your assigned condition)

Once you are done with the two problem-solving tasks above, go to the folders:
c) “AQ Posttest” to access two posttest notebooks related to problem-solving task 1 (“AQ_DA assessment” and “AQ_NT assessment”). You can solve these two posttest workbooks in any order.
d) “SC Posttest” to access two posttest notebooks related to problem-solving task 2 (“AQ_DA assessment” and “AQ_NT assessment”). You can solve these two posttest workbooks in any order.
